# Less-than-or-Equal-to---2

Question Explanation:

The program aims to compare two integers, A and B, based on two conditions:

Whether A is less than or equal to B.
Whether B is less than or equal to A.
The result of each comparison is printed as a boolean value (True or False).

Logical Approach:

Read Input:
Read two integers from the input: A (first integer) and B (second integer).

Compare A and B:
Check if A is less than or equal to B using the comparison operator <=. This evaluates to either True or False.

Compare B and A:
Check if B is less than or equal to A using the comparison operator <=. This also evaluates to either True or False.

Output Results:
Print the result of A <= B in the format: "A <= B is [Result]".
Print the result of B <= A in the format: "B <= A is [Result]".

Example for Clarity:

If the input values for A and B are 5 and 3, respectively:
Checking if A is less than or equal to B: 5 <= 3, which is False.
Checking if B is less than or equal to A: 3 <= 5, which is True.
The output will be:

A <= B is False

B <= A is True
